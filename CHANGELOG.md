and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed orchestrator lazy property initialization and configuration normalization logic in `Orchestrator`.
- Resolved `AssertionError` in orchestrator tests by aligning test mocks with production component usage.
- Fixed dependency compatibility issues by pinning `protobuf==4.25.8` (Security Fix: Addresses DoS vulnerability) and `grpcio==1.67.1`.
- Added missing dependencies `GitPython` and `chardet` to `pyproject.toml`.
- Verified and aligned `FileObject.text` property usage in GraphRAG notebooks for consistent content decoding.

### Added
- **Semantic Extract Improvements**:
    - Introduced `auto-chunking` for long text processing in LLM extraction methods (`extract_entities_llm`, `extract_relations_llm`, `extract_triplets_llm`).
    - Added `silent_fail` parameter to LLM extraction methods for configurable error handling.
    - Implemented robust JSON parsing and automatic retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff) in `BaseProvider` for all LLM providers.
    - Enhanced `GroqProvider` with better diagnostics and connectivity testing.
    - Added comprehensive entity, relation, and triplet deduplication for chunked extraction.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `TripletExtractor` where the `validate_triplets` method was shadowed by an internal attribute.
- Fixed incorrect `TextSplitter` import path in the `semantic_extract.methods` module.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- Exported `DoclingParser` and `DoclingMetadata` from `semantica.parse` for easier access.

- Automated release workflow with Trusted Publishing support.

### Changed
- Updated versioning across the framework to 0.1.0.
- Refined entry point configurations in `pyproject.toml`.
