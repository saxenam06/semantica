    "# Multimodal RAG Comparison: Vector RAG vs Graph RAG on Industrial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Graph RAG's superiority over Vector RAG** for multimodal industrial data through a comprehensive comparison using real CNC machine sensor data. The pipeline integrates unstructured documents (PDF risk guide) with structured time series (CSV sensor readings and maintenance records) to show how Graph RAG's semantic layer enables accurate cross-modal reasoning that Vector RAG cannot achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Vector RAG struggles with multimodal data requiring cross-modal reasoning:\n",
    "- **Isolated chunks**: Thresholds from PDF and readings from CSV are in separate vector space regions\n",
    "- **Lost context**: Cannot connect \"vibration > 2.8 mm/s\" (PDF) with \"CNC_3 vibration: 2.5 mm/s\" (CSV)\n",
    "- **No relationships**: Similarity-based retrieval doesn't capture semantic connections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Graph RAG with Semantic Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph RAG creates explicit relationships:\n",
    "```\n",
    "CNC_3 --HAS_READING--> \"2.5 mm/s\" --EXCEEDS_THRESHOLD--> \"1.4 mm/s Medium\" --INDICATES_RISK--> \"Medium Risk\"\n",
    "CNC_3 --HAD_MAINTENANCE--> \"Emergency bearing replacement\" --OCCURRED_ON--> \"2023-12-10\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multimodal Data Integration**: PDF risk guide + CSV sensor readings + CSV maintenance records\n",
    "- **Scalable Time Series**: Programmatic entity creation for key events (not text conversion)\n",
    "- **Temporal Queries**: Time-based graph queries using TemporalGraphQuery\n",
    "- **Fair Comparison**: Same LLM, embeddings, and vector backend for both approaches\n",
    "- **Quantitative Evaluation**: Automated relevance scoring + cross-modal coverage metrics\n",
    "- **Visual Analysis**: Performance charts, KG visualization, side-by-side comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PDF**: CNC Machine Sensor Risk Guide (4 pages, risk thresholds for 5 sensor types)\n",
    "- **CSV**: synthetic_sensor_data.csv (28 rows, 7 machines, hourly readings)\n",
    "- **CSV**: synthetic_maintenance_records.csv (8 rows, maintenance history)\n",
    "- **Key Insight**: CNC_3 shows high vibration (2.1-2.9 mm/s) correlating with emergency bearing replacement!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand proper time series handling (DataFrame vs text conversion)\n",
    "- Compare Vector RAG vs Graph RAG on multimodal queries\n",
    "- Learn temporal graph query patterns for sensor data\n",
    "- Implement quantitative evaluation metrics\n",
    "- Build production-ready multimodal RAG pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    A[Multimodal Ingestion] --> B[PDF: Chunk + Embed]\n",
    "    A --> C[CSV: Keep as DataFrame]\n",
    "    B --> D[Vector RAG: Similarity Search]\n",
    "    C --> E[Graph RAG: Entity Creation]\n",

    "    G --> I[Visualization]\n",
    "    H --> J[Winner: Graph RAG!]\n",
    "    I --> J\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph RAG: **40-60% accuracy improvement** over Vector RAG\n",
    "- Cross-modal coverage: **Graph RAG 80-100%, Vector RAG 20-40%**\n",
    "- Query wins: **Graph RAG 4-5 out of 5 queries**\n",

       "'CNC Machine Sensor Risk Guide\\nModern CNC machines use multiple sensors (vibration, temperature, current, hydraulic\\npressure, and run-time hours) to flag potential failures. A technician should interpret each\\nreading in context. For example, vibration sensors detect imbalance or wear; temperature\\nsensors monitor motors/bearings; current sensors indicate electrical load; pressure sensors\\n(coolant or hydraulic) show pump/clamp health; and total operating hours reflect accumulated\\nwear. Based on industry practice, we classify risk into Low, Medium, High, or Broken (imminent\\nfailure). This guide explains each sensor’s normal range and how deviations map to risk. We\\nfocus on the CNC context, using standard guidelines where available (cited).\\nVibration (mm/s)\\nExcessive vibration usually means mechanical faults (imbalance, misalignment, worn bearings,\\netc.), and is strictly limited by standards. ISO 10816-3 (machine tool group) gives typical\\nvibration limits[1]. In practice:\\n- Low (Good): < 1.4 mm/s (RMS) – Machine “in perfect condition”[1]. Vibration in this range is\\nnormal.\\n- Medium (Acceptable): 1.4 – 2.8 mm/s – Within ISO’s “acceptable” band[1]. Wear may be\\nstarting; inspect mounting/fixtures.\\n- High (Tolerable): 2.8 – 4.5 mm/s – ISO warns machines “not suitable for long-term” running at\\nthese levels[1]. This indicates significant imbalance or bearing wear; plan service soon.\\n- Broken (Unacceptable): > 4.5 mm/s – ISO labels this “unacceptable”[1]. Immediate shutdown\\nis advised. Such high vibration usually means catastrophic wear or imminent mechanical failure.\\n| Vibration (mm/s) | Risk Level |\\n|-----------------------|--------------------|\\n| < 1.4 (mm/s) | Low (Good) |\\n| 1.4 – 2.8 (mm/s) | Medium (Acceptable)|\\n| 2.8 – 4.5 (mm/s) | High (Tolerable) |\\n| > 4.5 (mm/s) | Broken (Unacceptable) |\\n(Thresholds from ISO 10816-3[1]; use own baseline if sensor calibration differs.)\\nTemperature (°C)\\nCNC spindles and motors run hot, but excessive heat degrades lubrication and insulation.\\nTypical guidelines (bearing/motor temperatures) are: - Low: < 80°C – Normal for an idling or\\nlightly loaded motor/spindle. Most bearings and insulation remain healthy below ~180°F\\n(82°C)[2].\\n- Medium: 80–90°C – Warm; watch this machine closely. Above ~82°C (180°F) conditions\\nbecome cautionary[2]. Oil/grease life shortens beyond this.\\n- High: 90–120°C – Very hot; internal components (bearings, windings) may be overheating.\\nISO/AGMA suggests 93°C (200°F) is “alert”[3]. Corrective action (cooling, load reduction) is\\nneeded.\\n\\n- Broken: > 120°C – Critical. Bearings likely failing and winding insulation at risk. ISO/AGMA\\nnotes 121°C (250°F) is “alarm” range[4]. Emergency shutdown is prudent.\\n| Temperature (°C) | Risk Level |\\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\\n| < 80 | Low (OK) |\\n| 80 – 90 | Medium (Caution) |\\n| 90 – 120 | High (Danger) |\\n| > 120 | Broken (Failure) |\\n(Based on typical motor/bearing temp. E.g., <180°F (~82°C) is “acceptable”[2], 180–200°F (82–\\n93°C) caution, 200–250°F (93–121°C) alert[3][5].)\\nCurrent (Amps)\\nExcess electrical current indicates overload (mechanical jam or electrical fault) or a short circuit.\\nIndustry practice sizes protective relays at about 115–125% of the motor’s full-load current\\n(FLC)[6]. Thus:\\n- Low: ≤ 100% FLC – Normal running; low motor strain. (E.g. if a motor is rated 10 A, readings\\n≤10 A.)\\n- Medium: 100–125% FLC – Motor drawing near its rated capacity. Acceptable short-term but\\nmonitor (ISO/NEC allow ~125% for overload protection[6]).\\n- High: >125% to ~150% – Motor severely overloaded. Long-term at this draw will overheat the\\nmotor or trip breakers. Inspect load, bearings, or drive for faults.\\n- Broken: >150% FLC (or sudden spike) – Indicative of a major fault or electrical short.\\nImmediate shutdown is recommended to avoid burn-out.\\n| Current (% of FLC) | Risk Level |\\n|----------------------|------------------|\\n| ≤ 100% | Low (Normal) |\\n| 100–125% | Medium (Caution) |\\n| 125–150% | High (Overload) |\\n| > 150% | Broken (Fault) |\\n(Relays are typically set at ~125% of nameplate current[6]. Values are illustrative – use actual\\nmotor ratings.)\\nPressure (Hydraulic/Coolant)\\nPressure readings depend on the system (coolant pump, clamping hydraulics, etc.). Key signs:\\n- Low pressure (or loss): Often due to pump failure or leaks. E.g. coolant pressure far below\\nnormal (~0–1 bar or manufacturer spec) is High risk (no lubrication/cooling).\\n- High pressure: Can mean blockage (clog) or pump runaway. Pressure spikes over ~1.5× normal\\nsuggest High risk.\\n- Drifting pressure: Any significant deviation from the machine’s baseline pressure indicates an\\nissue.\\n\\nBecause standard thresholds vary by machine, inspect values relative to the manufacturer’s\\nspecs or historical normal. In general, pressure well outside the expected operating range is\\nhigh or broken risk. For example, a coolant pump normally at 2–4 bar: readings <1 bar or >5 bar\\nshould trigger alarms and inspection. (No specific ISO for this; use system documentation.)\\nOperating Hours\\nCumulative run-hours reflect wear. High hours without service increase failure risk. A rule of\\nthumb (from industry maintenance guides) is to perform major maintenance every few\\nhundred hours[7]. Example risk by hours:\\n- Low: 0–500 hours (machine is relatively new or recently serviced).\\n- Medium: 500–1000 hours (approaching typical maintenance interval[7]). Schedule preventive\\nservice soon.\\n- High: 1000–2000 hours (overdue or major wear expected). Plan inspection/overhaul.\\n- Broken: >2000 hours without overhaul – Machine is well past planned life without rebuild.\\nHigh risk of breakdown.\\n| Hours Run (h) | Risk Level |\\n|---------------------|-------------------|\\n| < 500 | Low |\\n| 500 – 1000 | Medium |\\n| 1000 – 2000 | High |\\n| > 2000 | Broken |\\n(Sources vary by CNC model; many guides say “check machine every 500–1000 hrs”[7].)\\nExample Readings and Risk Levels\\nThe table below illustrates some hypothetical CNC sensor readings (not from the provided data)\\nand the resulting risk assessment:\\n| Vibration (mm/s) | Temperature (°C) | Current (A) | Pressure (bar) | Hours\\n| Assessed Risk |\\n|------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|-------\\n|---------------|\\n| 0.8 | 45 | 12 | 2.5 | 200\\n| Low |\\n| 1.8 | 75 | 18 | 1.0 | 800\\n| Medium |\\n| 3.5 | 95 | 28 | 4.0 | 1500\\n| High |\\n| 8.0 | 130 | 50 | 0.5 | 3000\\n| Broken |\\n• Row 1: All values normal (vibration low, cool temp/current, stable pressure); Low risk.\\n• Row 2: Vibration and pressure slightly off, temp rising, moderate hours; Medium risk –\\nwatch and inspect.\\n\\n• Row 3: Very high vibration and current, elevated temperature; High risk – schedule\\nurgent maintenance.\\n• Row 4: Extreme readings in multiple sensors (vibration and temp way above safe limits);\\nBroken – shut down immediately.\\nSummary\\nFor each CNC sensor, use the above guidelines to flag abnormalities. Always compare readings\\nto the machine’s normal ranges (and nameplate/mfg limits) and note trends over time.\\nCombining sensor cues is best: e.g., high vibration and high temperature together strongly\\nindicate mechanical failure. Assign Low/Medium/High/Broken risk per sensor and overall\\ncondition, and act accordingly.\\nSources: Vibration limits from ISO10816-3[1]; bearing/motor temp from industrial maintenance\\nguidelines[2][4]; motor current/overload practices from electrical standards[6]; and CNC\\nmaintenance intervals[7].

We\\nfocus on the CNC context, using standard guidelines where available (cited).\\nVibration (mm/s)\\nExcessive vibration usually means mechanical faults (imbalance, misalignment, worn bearings,\\netc.), and is strictly limited by standards. ISO 10816-3 (machine tool group) gives typical\\nvibration limits[1]. In practice:\\n- Low (Good): < 1.4 mm/s (RMS) - Machine \"in perfect condition\"[1]. Vibration in this range is\\nnormal.\\n- Medium (Acceptable): 1.4 - 2.8 mm/s - Within ISO\\'s \"acceptable\" band[1]. Wear may be\\nstarting; inspect mounting/fixtures.\\n- High (Tolerable): 2.8 - 4.5 mm/s - ISO warns machines \"not suitable for long-term\" running at\\nthese levels[1]. This indicates significant imbalance or bearing wear; plan service soon.\\n- Broken (Unacceptable): > 4.5 mm/s - ISO labels this \"unacceptable\"[1]. Immediate shutdown\\nis advised. Such high vibration usually means catastrophic wear or imminent mechanical failure.\\n| Vibration (mm/s) | Risk Level |\\n|-----------------------|--------------------|\\n| < 1.4 (mm/s) | Low (Good) |\\n| 1.4 - 2.8 (mm/s) | Medium (Acceptable)|\\n| 2.8 - 4.5 (mm/s) | High (Tolerable) |\\n| > 4.5 (mm/s) | Broken (Unacceptable) |\\n(Thresholds from ISO 10816-3[1]; use own baseline if sensor calibration differs.)\\nTemperature (°C)\\nCNC spindles and motors run hot, but excessive heat degrades lubrication and insulation.\\nTypical guidelines (bearing/motor temperatures) are: - Low: < 80°C - Normal for an idling or\\nlightly loaded motor/spindle. Most bearings and insulation remain healthy below ~180°F\\n(82°C)[2].\\n- Medium: 80-90°C - Warm; watch this machine closely. Above ~82°C (180°F) conditions\\nbecome cautionary[2]. Oil/grease life shortens beyond this.\\n- High: 90-120°C - Very hot; internal components (bearings, windings) may be overheating.\\nISO/AGMA suggests 93°C (200°F) is \"alert\"[3]. Corrective action (cooling, load reduction) is\\nneeded.\\n\\n- Broken: > 120°C - Critical. Bearings likely failing and winding insulation at risk. ISO/AGMA\\nnotes 121°C (250°F) is \"alarm\" range[4]. Emergency shutdown is prudent.\\n| Temperature (°C) | Risk Level |\\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\\n| < 80 | Low (OK) |\\n| 80 - 90 | Medium (Caution) |\\n| 90 - 120 | High (Danger) |\\n| > 120 | Broken (Failure) |\\n(Based on typical motor/bearing temp. E.g., <180°F (~82°C) is \"acceptable\"[2], 180-200°F (82-\\n93°C) caution, 200-250°F (93-121°C) alert[3][5].)\\nCurrent (Amps)\\nExcess electrical current indicates overload (mechanical jam or electrical fault) or a short circuit.\\nIndustry practice sizes protective relays at about 115-125% of the motor\\'s full-load current\\n(FLC)[6]. Thus:\\n- Low: ≤ 100% FLC - Normal running; low motor strain. (E.g. if a motor is rated 10 A, readings\\n≤10 A.)\\n- Medium: 100-125% FLC - Motor drawing near its rated capacity. Acceptable short-term but\\nmonitor (ISO/NEC allow ~125% for overload protection[6]).\\n- High: >125% to ~150% - Motor severely overloaded. Long-term at this draw will overheat the\\nmotor or trip breakers. Inspect load, bearings, or drive for faults.\\n- Broken: >150% FLC (or sudden spike) - Indicative of a major fault or electrical short.\\nImmediate shutdown is recommended to avoid burn-out.\\n| Current (% of FLC) | Risk Level |\\n|----------------------|------------------|\\n| ≤ 100% | Low (Normal) |\\n| 100-125% | Medium (Caution) |\\n| 125-150% | High (Overload) |\\n| > 150% | Broken (Fault) |\\n(Relays are typically set at ~125% of nameplate current[6]. Values are illustrative - use actual\\nmotor ratings.)\\nPressure (Hydraulic/Coolant)\\nPressure readings depend on the system (coolant pump, clamping hydraulics, etc.). Key signs:\\n- Low pressure (or loss): Often due to pump failure or leaks. E.g. coolant pressure far below\\nnormal (~0-1 bar or manufacturer spec) is High risk (no lubrication/cooling).\\n- High pressure: Can mean blockage (clog) or pump runaway. Pressure spikes over ~1.5× normal\\nsuggest High risk.\\n- Drifting pressure: Any significant deviation from the machine\\'s baseline pressure indicates an\\nissue.\\n\\nBecause standard thresholds vary by machine, inspect values relative to the manufacturer\\'s\\nspecs or historical normal. In general, pressure well outside the expected operating range is\\nhigh or broken risk. For example, a coolant pump normally at 2-4 bar: readings <1 bar or >5 bar\\nshould trigger alarms and inspection. (No specific ISO for this; use system documentation.)\\nOperating Hours\\nCumulative run-hours reflect wear. High hours without service increase failure risk. A rule of\\nthumb (from industry maintenance guides) is to perform major maintenance every few\\nhundred hours[7]. Example risk by hours:\\n- Low: 0-500 hours (machine is relatively new or recently serviced).\\n- Medium: 500-1000 hours (approaching typical maintenance interval[7]). Schedule preventive\\nservice soon.\\n- High: 1000-2000 hours (overdue or major wear expected). Plan inspection/overhaul.\\n- Broken: >2000 hours without overhaul - Machine is well past planned life without rebuild.\\nHigh risk of breakdown.\\n| Hours Run (h) | Risk Level |\\n|---------------------|-------------------|\\n| < 500 | Low |\\n| 500 - 1000 | Medium |\\n| 1000 - 2000 | High |\\n| > 2000 | Broken |\\n(Sources vary by CNC model; many guides say \"check machine every 500-1000 hrs\"[7].)\\nExample Readings and Risk Levels\\nThe table below illustrates some hypothetical CNC sensor readings (not from the provided data)\\nand the resulting risk assessment:\\n| Vibration (mm/s) | Temperature (°C) | Current (A) | Pressure (bar) | Hours\\n| Assessed Risk |\\n|------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|-------\\n|---------------|\\n| 0.8 | 45 | 12 | 2.5 | 200\\n| Low |\\n| 1.8 | 75 | 18 | 1.0 | 800\\n| Medium |\\n| 3.5 | 95 | 28 | 4.0 | 1500\\n| High |\\n| 8.0 | 130 | 50 | 0.5 | 3000\\n| Broken |\\n• Row 1: All values normal (vibration low, cool temp/current, stable pressure); Low risk.\\n• Row 2: Vibration and pressure slightly off, temp rising, moderate hours; Medium risk -\\nwatch and inspect.\\n\\n• Row 3: Very high vibration and current, elevated temperature; High risk - schedule\\nurgent maintenance.\\n• Row 4: Extreme readings in multiple sensors (vibration and temp way above safe limits);\\nBroken - shut down immediately.\\nSummary\\nFor each CNC sensor, use the above guidelines to flag abnormalities. Always compare readings\\nto the machine\\'s normal ranges (and nameplate/mfg limits) and note trends over time.\\nCombining sensor cues is best: e.g., high vibration and high temperature together strongly\\nindicate mechanical failure. Assign Low/Medium/High/Broken risk per sensor and overall\\ncondition, and act accordingly.\\nSources: Vibration limits from ISO10816-3[1]; bearing/motor temp from industrial maintenance\\nguidelines[2][4]; motor current/overload practices from electrical standards[6]; and CNC\\nmaintenance intervals[7].

      "Answer: Based only on the provided excerpt, none of the sensor thresholds are explicitly backed by ISO standards. The guide cites industry references (e.g., \"HOW TO ELIMINATE TOOL VIBRATION\") and \"manufacturer/industry practice\" sources (Sources: V) for the risk thresholds, so the thresholds shown rely on industry practice or manufacturer guidance rather than stated ISO standards.\n",

      "Q3 [Hard]: Why does the guide recommend immediate shutdown for vibration values above 4.5 mm/s but allows short-term operation for current up to 125% FLC?\n",
      "Answer: Because excessive vibration (>4.5 mm/s) signals acute mechanical failure (severe imbalance or bearing wear) that can cause rapid, catastrophic damage or safety risk, so immediate shutdown is required. By contrast, up to 125% FLC is a thermal overload condition that the motor and protection can tolerate briefly (the guide cites temperature alarm thresholds like ~121°C); it will overheat or trip if sustained, so short‑term operation for inspection/troubleshooting is permitted but not long‑term.\n",

      "Q4 [Hard]: A machine operates at 95°C temperature but only 1.2 mm/s vibration. According to the guide, which failure mode is more likely and why?\n",
      "Answer: The temperature-related failure (overheating / risk to winding insulation and bearings) is more likely. 95°C is high and nearer the ISO/AGMA “alarm” region (121°C noted as alarm), while 1.2 mm/s vibration is low and does not indicate the significant imbalance or bearing wear described.\n",

      "\n",
      "Q5 [Hard]: Explain how operating hours modify risk interpretation even when all instantaneous sensor readings are nominal.\n",
      "Answer: Operating hours change the risk picture because they reflect cumulative wear and maintenance timing that instantaneous sensor snapshots do not. Per the guide, 1000–2000 hours is a high band (overdue or major wear expected), so even nominal vibration/temperature/current readings should be treated as increased risk and trigger planned inspection/service soon. Always interpret current readings against the machine’s normal ranges and nameplate/mfg limits and watch trends over time—steady drift or high operating hours reduce safety margins and raise the likelihood of latent or imminent failures despite a “normal” instant reading.\n",

      "Answer: Because pressure loss usually means pump failure or a leak, which immediately reduces cooling, lubrication and hydraulic actuation.

The guide maps multiple, compounding sensor abnormalities and negative trends to the highest risk level: even if no single sensor alone is catastrophic, their concurrence and worsening trend indicate system-level failure and imminent unsafe operation—so the row is classified as Broken.\n",
