Entity Merger Module

This module provides entity merging capabilities for the Semantica framework,
performing semantic deduplication to merge semantically similar entities and
maintain knowledge graph cleanliness.

Algorithms Used:
    - Strategy Pattern: Multiple merge strategies (keep_first, keep_last, keep_most_complete, etc.)
    - Conflict Resolution: Voting, credibility-weighted, temporal, confidence-based resolution
    - Property Merging: Rule-based property combination with custom rules and priorities
    - Relationship Preservation: Union of relationship sets during merges
    - Provenance Tracking: Metadata preservation during merges with source tracking
    - Merge Quality Validation: Validation of merged entities for completeness and consistency

Key Features:
    - Merge duplicate entities using configurable strategies
    - Preserve provenance information during merges (tracks merged entity sources)
    - Incremental merging of new entities with existing ones
    - Conflict resolution for property and relationship merging
    - Merge history tracking and quality validation
    - Automatic duplicate detection and grouping before merging
    - Support for custom merge strategies and conflict resolution functions

Main Classes:
    - EntityMerger: Main entity merging engine
    - MergeOperation: Entity merge operation representation with metadata

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.deduplication import EntityMerger, MergeStrategy
    >>> merger = EntityMerger(preserve_provenance=True)
    >>> operations = merger.merge_duplicates(
    ...     entities,
    ...     strategy="keep_most_complete"
    ... )
    >>> history = merger.get_merge_history()
    >>> 
    >>> # Access merged entities
    >>> merged = [op.merged_entity for op in operations]

        Validate quality of a merge operation.

        This method checks the quality of a merge operation by validating the
        merged entity and checking for issues like missing required fields or
        unresolved conflicts.

        Args:
            merge_operation: MergeOperation object to validate

        Returns:
            Dictionary containing validation results:
                - valid: Whether merge is valid (bool)
                - issues: List of validation issues found
                - quality_score: Quality score (0.0 to 1.0)

        Example:
            >>> operation = merger.merge_entity_group(entities)
            >>> validation = merger.validate_merge_quality(operation)
            >>> if not validation["valid"]:
